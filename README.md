### Hi there üëã I'm Jingmin Wei (È≠èÈùñÊóª)

Hi! I'm a second-year M.S. student studying at Univ. of Southern California, majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/). 

I'm fortunate to work with [Zhaoheng Zheng](https://zhaohengz.github.io/) and [Prof. Ram Nevatia](https://sites.usc.edu/iris-cvlab/professor-ram-nevatia/) at [IRIS CV Lab](https://sites.usc.edu/iris-cvlab/). My research interest lines in the area of security and parameter-efficient learning, including Vision Robust Representation (Adversarial Learning), Multi-modal Adapter, and Prompt Learning.

Prior to USC, I obtained my B.E. degree at the [School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation](http://english.aia.hust.edu.cn/), Huazhong Univ. of Sci. and Tech. I worked as an undergrad research assistant, advised by prof [Sheng Zhong](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/zhongsheng/en/index.htm), focusing on research about Facial Language Analysis and Understanding.

I've written some study blogs and basic tutorials (in Mandarin) on PyTorch, which already harvested more than 60K views and hundreds of bookmarks. If you're interested, [click the link](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_44979150/category_11618935.html) and browse on your own.
