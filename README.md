### Hi there üëã I'm Jingmin Wei (È≠èÈùñÊóª)

Hi! I'm a second-year M.S. student studying at Univ. of Southern California, majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/). 

I am very fortunate to work at [IRIS Computer Vision Lab](https://sites.usc.edu/iris-cvlab/) under the guidance of Prof. [Prof. Ram Nevatia](https://sites.usc.edu/iris-cvlab/professor-ram-nevatia/), collaborating closely with [Zhaoheng Zheng](https://zhaohengz.github.io/). My research interest lies in the area of robustness and efficiency, including learning visual robust representation against adversarial attack and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Prior to USC, I obtained my B.E. degree at the [School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation](http://english.aia.hust.edu.cn/), Huazhong Univ. of Science and Technology. Advised by Prof. [Sheng Zhong](http://english.aia.hust.edu.cn/info/1030/1347.htm), I focused on research about building emotion assess system based on facial language understanding.

I've written some study blogs and basic tutorials (in Mandarin) on PyTorch, which already harvested more than 60K views and hundreds of bookmarks. If you're interested, [click the link](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_44979150/category_11618935.html) and browse on your own.
