### Hi there üëã I'm Jingmin Wei (È≠èÈùñÊóª)

Hi! I'm a second-year M.S. student studying at Univ. of Southern California, majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/). 

I am very fortunate to work at [IRIS Computer Vision Lab](https://sites.usc.edu/iris-cvlab/) under the guidance of Prof. [Ram Nevatia](https://sites.usc.edu/iris-cvlab/professor-ram-nevatia/), collaborating closely with [Zhaoheng Zheng](https://zhaohengz.github.io/). My research interest lies in the area of robustness and efficiency, including learning robust visual representation, focusing on strengthening models' resilience against adversarial attacks, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, aiming to achieve greater efficacy in multi-modal optimization.

Prior to USC, I obtained my B.E. degree at the [School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation](http://english.aia.hust.edu.cn/), Huazhong Univ. of Science and Technology (a Top 10 university in China). Advised by Prof. [Sheng Zhong](http://english.aia.hust.edu.cn/info/1030/1347.htm), I focused on research about building emotion assess system based on facial language understanding.

I've organized some course notes about machine learning, and I've also written some study blogs and basic tutorials (in Mandarin) on PyTorch, which already harvested more than 60K views and hundreds of bookmarks.
