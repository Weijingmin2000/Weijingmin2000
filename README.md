### Hi there 👋 I'm Jingmin Wei (魏靖旻)

I'm a first-year M.S. student at [Univ. of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), majoring in Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence.

I'm currently a research assistant at [IRIS CV Lab](https://sites.usc.edu/iris-cvlab/), advised by prof Ram Nevatia. My research interests include Robust Representation, Few-shot Learning, and Multi-modal Adapter.

Before coming to USC, I obtained my B.Eng. degree at the School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, [Huazhong Univ. of Science & Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/). I worked as an undergraduate research assistant, advised by prof Sheng Zhong, focusing on research about PIV, Facial Language Analysis & Understanding.

I've written some study blogs and basic tutorials (in Mandarin) on PyTorch before. If you're insterested, click the [link](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_44979150/category_11618935.html) and browse on your own.
