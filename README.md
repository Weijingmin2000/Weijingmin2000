### Hi there 👋 I'm Jingmin Wei (魏靖旻)

I'm a second-year M.S. student at Univ. of Southern California, majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/).

I'm a research assistant at [IRIS CV Lab](https://sites.usc.edu/iris-cvlab/), advised by prof Ram Nevatia. My research interests include Computer Vision, Robustness (Adversarial Learning), and Parameter-efficient Learning.

Before coming to USC, I obtained my B.Eng. degree at the School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, [Huazhong Univ. of Science & Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/). I worked as an undergraduate research assistant, advised by prof Sheng Zhong, focusing on research about Facial Language Analysis and understanding.

I've written some study blogs and basic tutorials (in Mandarin) on PyTorch, which already harvested more than 60K views and hundreds of bookmarks. If you're interested, [click the link](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_44979150/category_11618935.html) and browse on your own.
