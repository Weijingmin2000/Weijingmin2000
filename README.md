### Hi there üëã I'm Jingmin Wei (È≠èÈùñÊóª)

Hi! I'm a second-year M.S. student studying at Univ. of Southern California, majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/). 

I'm fortunate to work with [Prof. Ram Nevatia](https://sites.usc.edu/iris-cvlab/professor-ram-nevatia/) and [Dr. Zhaoheng Zheng](https://zhaohengz.github.io/) at [IRIS Computer Vision Lab](https://sites.usc.edu/iris-cvlab/). My research interest lines in the area of stability and efficiency, including Vision Robust Representation (Adversarial Learning) and Parameter-efficient Learning (Multi-modal Adapter, Prompt Learning).

Prior to USC, I obtained my B.E. degree at the [School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation](http://english.aia.hust.edu.cn/), Huazhong Univ. of Science and Technology. I worked as an undergrad research assistant, advised by [Prof. Sheng Zhong](http://english.aia.hust.edu.cn/info/1030/1347.htm), focusing on research about Facial Language Analysis and Understanding.

I've written some study blogs and basic tutorials (in Mandarin) on PyTorch, which already harvested more than 60K views and hundreds of bookmarks. If you're interested, [click the link](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_44979150/category_11618935.html) and browse on your own.
