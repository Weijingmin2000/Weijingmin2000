### Hi there, I'm Jingmin Wei (魏靖旻)

I'm a first-year M.S. student at [Univ. of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), majoring in Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence.

I'm currently a research assistant at USC IRIS CV Lab, advised by prof Ram Nevatia. My research interests include robust representation, few-shot learning, and multi-modality learning.

Before coming to USC, I obtained my B.Eng. degree at the school of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, [Huazhong Univ. of Science & Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/). I worked as an undergraduate research assistant, advised by prof Sheng Zhong, focusing on research about PIV, facial language analysis & understanding.
